# Profile-card
This repository hosts a lightweight Flask web application designed for creating a personal portfolio or profile page.
The application serves a single route ("/") and renders a clean and responsive HTML template ("index.html"). The template includes sections for the author's name, a profile picture, a short bio, and links to their GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.


# Features
Profile Information: The main page displays the author's name, a profile picture, and a brief but customizable description.

Social Media Links: The footer includes icons linked to the author's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, allowing visitors to connect with the author on these platforms.

# File Structure
app.py: This is the main Flask application script that sets up the web server and defines the route to render the HTML template.

templates/index.html: The HTML template responsible for presenting the author's profile information.
